# About {-}

Welcome to **SOST70073 Structural Equation Modelling**! This notebook will host the materials for all R practicals and demonstrations for this course unit. The notebook follows the same section-based structure as the learning materials on Blackboard. To access this notebook, you can bookmark it like any other website in your favourite web browser.    

For each section, you will have at least one practical to complete and each of these can be accessed by using the sidebar menu on the left hand side of your screen. Clicking on the headings in each section will expand the menu and each task can be accessed individually. 

The structure and options of this R notebook is identical to that of *SOST70033 Data Science Modelling*. The sidebar menu can be toggled on and off by clicking on the **Toggle Sidebar** button. Other customisation options include changing the font, font size, and the appearance. You also have a handy search button. To enhance your experience on tablet and mobile devices, it is recommended that you hide the sidebar menu and navigate across sections and subsections using the right and left arrows. The code, as well as the output and answers are provided for the practicals at the end of each section. The R code can be copied and pasted directly in your R console or script.

::: attention
**1:** Before beginning, it is recommended that you create a RStudio project for this course and work through the exercises and tasks in each section using this project. 

**2:** You should **write** and **save** your answers to the exercises and tasks in R scripts. You should have at least one R script for each course section. 

**3:** The recommended approach for a ‘clean’ working directory is to place all the data files you plan to use in a separate folder (e.g. a folder called *data*) within your R project working directory. You should always use simple names that allow you easy access to the contents when you want to either explore the folder on your machine or specify the path to these folders in R. 

**4:** To build a robust knowledge basis and adequately develop your practical programming skills, it is absolutely **essential** that you first attempt all practical tasks and exercises on your own before comparing your answers with those provided in this notebook. You must also follow along in all demonstrations that contain code on your own machines (*simply reading through the text and code will NOT be sufficient to develop a robust understanding of the method and its implementation in R*); note that you may also need to reflect on and answer questions throughout a demonstration as well.
