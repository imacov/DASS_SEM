## Practical 1 {-}

::: file
For the tasks below, you will require the **College** dataset from the
core textbook (James et. al 2021).

Click here to download the file:
<a href="data/College.csv" download="College.csv"> College.csv </a>.

*Remember to place your data file in a separate subfolder within your R
project working directory.*
:::

This data file contains 18 variables for 777 different universities and
colleges in the United States. The variables are:

-   Private : Public/private indicator
-   Apps : Number of applications received
-   Accept : Number of applicants accepted
-   Enroll : Number of new students enrolled
-   Top10perc : New students from top 10% of high school class
-   Top25perc : New students from top 25% of high school class
-   F.Undergrad : Number of full-time undergraduates
-   P.Undergrad : Number of part-time undergraduates
-   Outstate : Out-of-state tuition
-   Room.Board : Room and board costs
-   Books : Estimated book costs
-   Personal : Estimated personal spending
-   PhD : Percent of faculty with Ph.D.’s
-   Terminal : Percent of faculty with terminal degree
-   S.F.Ratio: Student/faculty ratio
-   perc.alumni : Percent of alumni who donate
-   Expend : Instructional expenditure per student
-   Grad.Rate : Graduation rate

### Task 1 {.unnumbered}

Import the dataset in an object called **college** using the tidyverse `read_csv()` function.

```{r warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
# Remember to load tidyverse first

library(tidyverse)

college <- read_csv("data/College.csv")
```

If you have a look at the contents of the data object using `View()`,
you will notice that the first column contains the names of all of the
universities in the dataset. You will also notice that it has a strange
name.

Actually, these data should not be treated as a variable (column) since
it is just a list of university names.

### Task 2 {.unnumbered}

Keeping the list of names in the data object, transform this column such
that the university names in the column become row names. Hint: use the
`column_to_rownames()` function from `dplyr`.

```{r warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
college <- college %>% column_to_rownames(var = "...1") 
```

::: question
How would have your approach to this task differed if you would have
imported the dataset using base R? Try it!
:::

::: answers
The data file could have instead been imported using `read.csv()`:

`college <- read.csv("data/College.csv")`

Using the base R approach, the first column containing the university
names would have been named "X", as shown below using `View()`.

<img src="images/snips/college-base-view.png" style="width: 60%;"/>

Now, how would be go about transforming the contents of the first column
into row names?

This would require two steps.

First, we assign the column contents to rows names.

`rownames(college) <- college[, 1]`

If you have another look at the data object, you will see that the rows
have now been renamed using the university names in the "X" column, but
the column is still part of the dataset. We therefore need to tell R to
delete the column.

`college <- college[, -1]`
:::

### Task 3 {.unnumbered}

Produce summary statistics for all variables in the data object.

```{r warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
summary(college)
```

### Task 4 {.unnumbered}

Create a scatterplot matrix of the first three numeric variables.

```{r warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
pairs(college[,2:4])
```

### Task 5 {.unnumbered}

Produce side by side box plots of `Outstate` versus `Private` using base
R.

```{r eval = FALSE}
plot(college$Private, college$Outstate, xlab = "Private", ylab = "Outstate")
```

::: question
Did this work? Why?
:::

::: answers
Using the `plot()` base R function to produce a box plot would produce
an error since the `Private` variable is of class character. Most
statistical functions will not work with character vectors.

`Error in plot.window(...) : need finite 'xlim' values`\
`In addition: Warning messages:`\
`1: In xy.coords(x, y, xlabel, ylabel, log) : NAs introduced by coercion`\
`2: In min(x) : no non-missing arguments to min; returning Inf`\
`3: In max(x) : no non-missing arguments to max; returning -Inf`

Creating a box plot with `tidyverse` would work.

`college %>%       ggplot(aes(x = Private, y = Outstate)) +        geom_boxplot()`

<img src="images/snips/private.png" style="width: 60%;"/>

However, it is important to note that if a variable is not of the right
class, then this might have unintended consequences for example, when
building models. In this case, the `Private` variable must be
transformed into a factor.
:::

### Task 6 {.unnumbered}

Using the `Top10perc` variable, create a new categorical variable called
`Elite` such that universities are divided into two groups based on
whether or not the proportion of students coming from the top 10% of
their high school classes exceeds 50%. Hint: use a combination of
`mutate()` and `if_else()`.

```{r warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
college <- college %>%
  mutate(Elite = if_else(Top10perc > 50, "Yes", "No"),
         Elite = as_factor(Elite))
#do not forget the factor transformation step (categorical variables are factors in R)
```

### Task 7 {.unnumbered}

Produce side by side box plots of the new `Elite` variable and
`Outstate`.

```{r}
college %>%  
  ggplot(aes(x = Elite, y = Outstate)) +   
  geom_boxplot()
```

::: question
How would you produce a similar plot using base R?
:::

::: answers
`plot(college$Elite, college$Outstate,  xlab = "Elite", ylab = "Outstate")`
:::

### Task 8 {.unnumbered}

Use base R to produce a multipanel plot that displays histograms of the
following variables: `Apps`, `perc.alumni`, `S.F.Ratio`, `Expend`. Hint:
use `par(mfrow=c(2,2))` to set up a 2x2 panel. Try to adjust the
specifications (e.g. breaks).

```{r}

# An example is shown below. Note that the purpose of the mfrow parameter is 
# to change the default way in which R displays plots.
# Once applied, all plots you create later will also be displayed in a 2x2 grid. 
# To revert back, you need to enter par(mfrow=c(1,1)) into the console.

par(mfrow=c(2,2))
hist(college$Apps)
hist(college$perc.alumni, col=2)
hist(college$S.F.Ratio, col=3, breaks=10)
hist(college$Expend, breaks=100)
```

### Task 9 {.unnumbered}

Using `Accept` and `Apps`, create a new variable that describes
acceptance rate. Name this variable `acceptance_rate`. Hint: use
`mutate()`.

```{r}
college <- college %>%
  mutate(acceptance_rate = Accept / Apps)
```

### Task 10 {.unnumbered}

Using the `acceptance_rate` variable, find out which university has the
lowest acceptance rate. Hint: for a `tidyverse` approach, you can use
`slice_min()`.

```{r}
college %>%
  slice_min(order_by = acceptance_rate, n = 1)
```

### Task 11 {.unnumbered}

Using the `acceptance_rate` variable, find out which university has the
highest acceptance rate.

```{r}
college %>%
  slice_max(order_by = acceptance_rate, n = 1)
```


## Practical 2 {-}

::: file
For the tasks below, you will require the **Boston** dataset. This
dataset is part of the `MASS` R package.

To access the dataset, load the `MASS` package (install the package
first, if you have not done so previously).
:::

### Task 1 {.unnumbered}

Install and load the `MASS` package. You will also require `tidyverse`.

```{r eval = FALSE}

# if you haven't already, install the MASS package before loading
install.packages("MASS")
library(MASS)
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, class.source = 'fold-show'} 

library(MASS)
library(tidyverse)
```

::: question
Does R provide any message when loading `MASS`? Why does this matter?
:::

::: answers
One important message that R provides when loading `MASS` is that this
package masks the `select()` function from `tidyverse`.

`Attaching package: ‘MASS’`

`The following object is masked from ‘package:dplyr’:`

```         
`select`  
```

When masking occurs, this means that both packages contain the same
function. If you were to use the `select()` function, R will call the
function from the `MASS` package, rather than from `tidyverse (dplyr)`
package. This is because the `MASS` package is the one masking the
function. If you intend to use the `select()` function as defined by the
`tidyverse` package, it may not work as intended and/or you may be
prompted by an error message such as:

`Error in select(...): unused argument (...)`

To avoid such issues, you must 'call' on the package from which you want
R to use the masked function (e.g. `dplyr::select()`). This is why it is
important to read through all warnings and messages provided in the
console.
:::

### Task 2 {.unnumbered}

Find out more about the `Boston` dataset variables by accessing the R
Documentation.

```{r eval = FALSE}
?Boston
```

To explore the `Boston` dataset, simply type the name of the data object
into the console or use `View()`

::: question
What type of data structure is the `Boston` dataset? What are its
dimensions? How many categorical and quantitative variables are there?
:::

::: answers
The `Boston` dataset is a data frame with 506 rows (observations) and 14
columns (variables). There is one categorical variable (`chas`), and 13
quantitative variables.
:::

### Task 3 {.unnumbered}

Find the class of all 14 variables. Hint: use `sapply`.

```{r}
sapply(Boston, class)
```

### Task 4 {.unnumbered}

Using a `tidyverse` approach, calculate the mean, median, and standard
deviation of all variables of class *numeric*.

```{r}
Boston %>%
  dplyr::select(dplyr::where(is.numeric)) %>%
  pivot_longer(everything()) %>%
  group_by(name) %>%
  summarise(Mean = mean(value, na.rm = TRUE),
            SD = sd(value, na.rm = TRUE), 
            Median = median(value, na.rm = TRUE))
```

::: question
What is the mean pupil-teacher ratio? What is the median and mean per
capita crime rate? Which value do you think is more suitable to describe
per capita crime rate?
:::

::: answers
The mean pupil-teacher ratio is about 19. The median crime rate is 0.257
whilst the mean is larger at 3.61. Given the difference between the
median and the mean, a skewed distribution is expected, therefore, the
median may be a more a suitable summary statistic to describe crime rate
(a histogram would be needed).
:::

### Task 5 {.unnumbered}

Using a base R approach, create a 2x2 multipanel plot of `crim` versus
`age`, `dis`, `rad`, `tax` and `ptratio`.

```{r}
par(mfrow = c(2,2))
plot(Boston$age, Boston$crim)
plot(Boston$dis, Boston$crim)
plot(Boston$rad, Boston$crim)
plot(Boston$tax, Boston$crim)
```

::: question
What can you say about the relationships between `age`, `dis`, `rad`,
`tax`, and `crim`?
:::

::: answers
As the age of the home increases (`age`), crime also increases. There is
also higher crime around employment centers (`dis`). With very high
index of accessibility to radial highways (`rad`), and tax rates (`tax`)
there also appears to be high crime rates.
:::

### Task 6 {.unnumbered}

Using a base R approach, create and display histograms of `crim`, `tax`
and `ptratio` in a 1x2 multipanel plot. Set the `breaks` argument to
**25** .

```{r}
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
hist(Boston$crim, breaks=25)
hist(Boston$tax, breaks=25)
```

::: question
What do these histograms indicate?
:::

::: answers
Most areas have low crime rates, but there is a rather long tail showing
high crime rates (although the frequency seems to be very low). Given
the degree of skew, the mean would not be a good measure of central
tendency. With respect to tax rates, there appears to be a large divide
between low taxation and high taxation, with the highest peak at around
670.

*Remember to revert back to single panel display.*
